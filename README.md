# Nintend'o'Match

Built using **Unity 2019.2.5f1** for **WebGL**.

This is my submission for my Unken Games application.  All code contained in this project was written by me over the course of Fri Sept 13th, 2019 - Mon Sept 16th 2019 with the exception of the ToN scripts.

The ToN namespace are utility scripts written by me and pulled in from other previous projects.

The Unity project is in the **Project** folder and a WebGL build that can be run with a localhost server is in **Builds/WebGL**.
